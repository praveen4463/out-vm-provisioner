Windows Zylitics Grid Provisioner (wzgp) is a Restful api at zylitics that can create windows grid servers at GCP.
Note: The term 'Grid' is used extensively in this application because at the time of writing a Grid
was supposed to be used in Zylitics, later on I decided to ditch the grid and put webdriver together
with the application on same machine so that there is no need of a hub-node structure. This app will
work in the same way it was provisioning a machine that will host zl-btbr, later we can refactor it
and update the term 'Grid' to 'Runner'. For now, leaving it as is.

There are three types of endpoints one can use:
1. https://wzgp-test.api.zylitics.io: used exclusively for production testing of this api and is completely internal to
   the application. Works only when a production testing workload is deployed on cluster.
2. https://wzgp.api.zylitics.io: should be used by other zylitics application outside the cluster.
3. http://wzgp.api.internal.zylitics.io: should be used by other zylitics application within the cluster. Uses cluster
   internal IP for communication.

Authentication:
  All external endpoints require authentication for user 'prod-test'.

Process:
- build docker image via jib:
mvn -DskipTest=true compile jib:build
or
mvn -X -Djib.serialize=true -Djib.console=plain compile jib:build

- Deploy endpoints config: gcloud endpoints services deploy openapi.yaml
