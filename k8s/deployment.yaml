# Before running:
    # 1. create secret for user 'prod-test' by using reference use reference,
         # https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/basic/
         # The secret should be named 'zl-wzgp-prod-test-auth'. The password will be stored in cloud
         # storage (same name as secret name) after encrypting using cloud kms.
         # Applications will download and decrypt the secret for
         # authenticating to the ingress (using authentication header's username:password value).
         # So, first generated a rand password, copy it somewhere and use htpasswd to
         # create a 'auth' file. Once all done, delete 'auth' file, encrypt password
         # before putting into bucket.
