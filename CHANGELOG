* while searching, small casing the search params before using them as label search because labels
  can't contain upper case

* In grid generator, when custom labels or metadata aren't given, don't try assigning them

**********
v0.3.0
**********
* Fixes in all type of handlers for speed improvements.
* There was a bug in executor that it was having a poll time of 10 sec for all type of operation
  status polling even if it is just a label update. This poll time delayed every operation. The
  timeout was also same for all operation. This is now changed and every resource decide it's
  own poll and timeout value.
* Tests are broken and not yet fixed. I am thinking not to fix them as I will rewrite the whole
  api soon. For now i will just fix all the integration tests asap.
* added profiling to all the processes
